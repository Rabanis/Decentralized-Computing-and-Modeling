# Decentralized-Computing-and-Modeling
Undergraduate course at CEID, University of Patras. This repo is my projects in the scope of the course.

This course had a lot to take from regarding decentralized computing and shed light on concepts like blockchain, leader elections, opinion dynamics and most of all how to efficiently model concepts and problems using the Netlogo language.

This is one of my favorite courses, making me more hungry and more eager to learn and study about computer science.

One should download Netlogo to run my models and see their results firsthand and experiment with variables.
